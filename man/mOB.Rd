\title{Deconvolved cell-type proportions from STdeconvolve for a Spatial Transcriptomic dataset of the mouse olfactory bulb along with the positions of their respective spots}
\format{
A list of 2 objects, each of 260 rows and 2 columns: data, which contains the 8 deconvolved cell-types proportions for each 260 spots/pixels in a spatial transcriptomics experiment performed on mouse olfactory bulb tissue and xy, which contains the x and y-coordinates for each 260 spots/pixels on a mouse olfactory bulb tissue slide.
