`scatterbar` is an open-source R package that provides an innovative visualization technique for displaying proportional data across spatially resolved contexts. This is the `scatterbar` R documentation website. Questions, suggestions, or problems should be submitted as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/JEFworks-Lab/scatterbar/issues).

## Overview

By combining the concepts of scatter plots and stacked bar charts, `scatterbar` enhances the clarity and distinguishability of proportional distributions, making it easier for users to detect subtle variations in data and accurately interpret and compare data across different spatial locations.

## Installation

To install `scatterbar`from GitHub, you can use `devtools`:

```r
devtools::install_github('JEFworks/scatterbar')
```

However, we currently recommend using `remotes`:

``` r
require(remotes)
remotes::install_github('JEFworks-Lab/scatterbar')
```
