`scatterbar` is an open-source R package that provides an innovative
visualization technique for displaying proportional data across
spatially resolved contexts. This is the `scatterbar` R documentation
website. Questions, suggestions, or problems should be submitted as
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/JEFworks-Lab/scatterbar/issues).

## Overview

By combining the concepts of scatter plots and stacked bar charts,
`scatterbar` enhances the clarity and distinguishability of proportional
distributions, making it easier for users to detect subtle variations in
data and accurately interpret and compare data across different spatial
locations.

## Installation

To install `scatterbar`from GitHub, you can use `devtools`:

``` r
devtools::install_github('JEFworks-Lab/scatterbar')
```

However, we currently recommend using `remotes`:

``` r
require(remotes)
remotes::install_github('JEFworks-Lab/scatterbar')
```
